# Integerating smart contract 

This Solidity program demonstrates the functionality of integerating smart contracts in Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to show how the smart contracts are intergerated and also to get the feel of both the frontend and the backend of the integeration of smart contracts this can be a stepping stone for anyone who wants to have a very brief idea about the same.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for basic calculations on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract here shows us both the front end and the backend of the integeration of smart contract, here we will learn how we integerate a smart contract by connecting to our wallet,adding the value and the confirmation on the wallet shows up on the screen, and also the backend of addition of the value and showing the total of all the calculatios. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to solidity programmers who want to understand both the frontend and backend working the integeration of smart contracts.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Gitpod, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Gitpod website at https://gitpod.io

I cloned the github, after cloning, ran a few commands in the terminal and reached out to  a localhost, typically  http://localhost:3000/ on this localhost my smart contract is shown the frontend part of this project is shown, so we'll need to link it to our wallet.

Once the wallet is linked, you can choose any of the two options provided that is 'sum of multiples of 15 and 17' or 'sum of multiples of 19 and 21'.

Your wallet will get the notification for the same and it'll show you a popup to confirm the transaction, by doing this you are adding the value to your total,you can follow the following steps a number of times to understand how smart contracts work.

At the backend the caluctions are done using a for loop and the value gets printed, this operation is the same for both the types and the balance is updated automatically. The connection of the wallet to this is done with the backend part and is quite understandalbw by the code.
